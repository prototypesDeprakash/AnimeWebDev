                    After her parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by
                    Eren Yeager and lived with him and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the 
                    fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on
                    Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant 
                    political power in Hizuru.Mikasa is a fairly tall and well-toned woman. She is of 
                    partial Asian heritage, with pale skin, gray eyes, and shaggy black hair that was 
                    long until she cut it to chin-length. By the year 854, her hair is shorter and cut 
                    up to the back of her neck, though she simultaneously wears noticeably longer bangs.
                    She bears a tattoo of the Azumabito family crest on the outside of her right wrist. 
                    There is a small scar below her right eye, which was due to an injury delivered by 
                    Eren's Titan during the Battle of Trost District.
