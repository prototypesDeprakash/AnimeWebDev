                    The film is about Suzume, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a quiet town in the Kyushu region of 
                    southwestern Japan. The story begins when Suzume meets a young man looking for a "door". The two 
                    travel together and find an old door at an abandoned house in the mountains. As if pulled by something, 
                    Suzume reaches out her hand towards the door and is pulled in. "Doors of Disaster" begin to appear across 
                    Japan, which started a series of unfortunate disasters. The film is a journey through Japan as Suzume needs
                    to close and lock the "Doors of Disaster" one by one to stop the disasters, as well as an adventure and battle
                    in the modern world in search of a girl's maturity and freedom
